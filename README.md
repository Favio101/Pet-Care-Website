# Paradigm Pet Professionals Website Redesign  

This project is a responsive, multi-page prototype developed as part of my UI/UX redesign project for a course at WGU. IT is designed for **Paradigm Pet Professionals**, a hypothetical virtual pet consultation company. The prototype replaces a 10-year-old website with a modern, accessible, and user-centered design.  

## Features  
- **Multi-Page Structure**: Home, Cats, Dogs, Birds, and Consultation pages.  
- **Semantic HTML5**: Clear, accessible structure following best practices.  
- **External CSS Styling**: Unified typography, color palette, responsive layout, and consistent branding.  
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Dropdown navigation menus, active page highlighting, and consultation form handling with inline thank-you message.  
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast design, alt-text placeholders, scalable typography, and touch-friendly elements.  
- **SEO Considerations**: Structured headings, metadata, and search-friendly content layout.  

## Pages  
- **Home**: Mission statement, adoption resources, and links to pet care content.  
- **Cats**: Age-specific care guidance with overview and structured sections.  
- **Dogs**: Diet, grooming, and vaccination guidance tailored to dog owners.  
- **Birds**: Relational needs, behavioral health, and signs of depression for bird owners (new persona).  
- **Consultation**: Interactive form to request a virtual consultation with all required fields.  

## Tech Stack  
- **HTML5** – semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – external stylesheet for design and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – navigation, form validation, and dynamic interactions  
- **Editor**: VS Code  

## Notes  
- The consultation form demonstrates required fields and interactions but does not send data to a backend service.
